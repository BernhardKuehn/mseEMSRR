# Introduction

This is an introduction.

### args

The *mp()* function takes as input a named list called *args*. These are arguments of the MSE run, and determine the time frame, frequency of application and lags. Only one argument is required:

- *iy*, intermediate year. Only required element in *args*. The first year in which the procedure is applied.

For all other, default values are generated acording to the *om* object dimensions, or from internal defaults, as follows:

- *y0*, first year. Defaults to start of *om*.
- *fy*, final year. Defaults to last year of *om*.
- nsqy, number of years to use for *status quo* calculations. Defaults to 3.
- *it*, number of iterations. Defaults to iterations in *om*.
- *data_lag*, difference between final year of data and *iy*. Defaults to 1.
- *management_lag*, number of years between year of year of application and implementation.
- *frq*, frequency. How often is the procedure to be applied, and for how long is a recommendation valid. Defaults to 1.

All these values can be simply overiden by including them in the *args* argument to *mp()*. The complete list of arguments is available to every *@method* function in any element in the MSE control. In addition, these year dimension nbames vector, generated inside *mp()*, can also be used in any module function:

- *vy*, the years in which the procedure is to be applied, from *iy* to *fy*. A character vector.
