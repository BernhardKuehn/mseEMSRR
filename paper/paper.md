# Summary

Simulation of marine and freshwater fishery systems with their two components is an increasingly used tool to evaluate the expected performance of alternative management procedures. These are a combination of data collection, estimation methods and decision rules, applied to obtain robust management advice under uncertainty. Operating models are constructed that represent both the natural fish populations and the fisheries exploiting them.
