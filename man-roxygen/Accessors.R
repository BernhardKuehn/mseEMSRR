#' @section Accessors:
#' All slots in the class have accessor and replacement methods defined that
#' allow retrieving and substituting individual slots.
#'
#' The values passed for replacement need to be of the class of that slot.
#' A numeric vector can also be used when replacing FLQuant slots, and the
#' vector will be used to substitute the values in the slot, but not its other
#' attributes.
